"""Example 5 — stream from the server over HTTP (Server-Sent Events).

Streaming needs TWO things: "stream": true in the JSON body (so the server sends
SSE), and stream=True on the request (so you can read it piece by piece).

First, start the server in another terminal:

    python app.py

Then run this from the project root:

    python examples/05_server_stream.py

The server sends lines like `data: {...}`; the text is in
choices[0].delta.content, the conversation_id arrives on the final chunk, and
the stream ends with `data: [DONE]`.
